## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

Full Stack Data Analyst with 3+ years of experience transforming fragmented, manual data processes into automated, scalable intelligence systems. I specialize in the complete data lifecycle: collection, cleaning, validation, storage, analysis, M&E framework implementation, insight generation, and executive-quality reporting. Built two production data analytics platforms -- one tracking 2,000+ equipment assets across 27 sites (70% reporting time reduction), another monitoring Agenda 2063 progress across all 55 AU member states with automated insights, gender & youth analytics, and an M&E logframe. Experienced with Python, SQL (PostgreSQL), dashboard design (Recharts, ECharts, Plotly), Supabase, DHIS2-ready architectures, and modern web frameworks (Next.js/React, FastAPI).
